# mloberg.github.io

My [main site](http://mlo.io) was hosted using Github Pages for the longest time.
Then I had some stability issues, so I moved it over to Amazon S3 and CloudFront.
I still wasn't completely happy with the speed of my page, so I added some custom
build components to it. It's really cool, and you should check out the
[repo for it](https://github.com/mloberg/mlo.io). Anyway, it's not compatible
with Github Pages anymore and I'm sick of getting emails about the builds
failing, so I'm putting up this placeholder site, which should just redirect to
my site in most cases.
